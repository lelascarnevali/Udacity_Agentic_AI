(Note: I'll include the Strunk & White text as references here, but in the final implementation, I won't copy *everything* if it's too long, just the highlights unless the user provided the full text. They did provide a lot of text, implying they want it used. I will put the reference in `references/style-guide.md`.)

Actually, they provided the full text of Strunk & White in the prompt. I will include it.
