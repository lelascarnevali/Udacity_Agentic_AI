# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository hosts Udacity Agentic AI exercises focused on effective prompting for LLM reasoning and planning. Keep guidance minimal, precise, and aligned with the actual workspace.

## 1. Repository Context
- Purpose: hands-on notebooks and lightweight utilities for LLM reasoning and planning.
- Stack: macOS + VS Code + Jupyter + Python.

```

## 3. Skills (skill.sh)
- integrate Copilot "skills" via a shell script.
- Skills location: `.github/skills/`.

## 3.1 Operating Workflow
- Always check for available skills relevant to the task in `.github/skills/` (and use discovery when needed).
- Always check agent memory notes in `.github/agents/memory/` for prior learnings that can inform the task.
- Analyze the request and outline a brief plan using the TODO tool before executing.
- Use concise tool preambles and group related actions; avoid unnecessary context loading.
- Execute changes minimally; bundle commits logically and only commit when asked or after confirming.

## 3.2 Language Policy
- Documentation, code comments, and prompt design: write in English.
- Chat responses to the user: reply in Portuguese (pt-BR).
- Keep examples consistent: internal artifacts in English; communication in Portuguese.


## 4. Virtual Environment
- Preferred: local virtualenv at `.venv/`.
- Setup on macOS:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python --version
pip --version
```

- Deactivate:

```sh
deactivate
```

## 5. Standards
- Python: follow PEP 8; prefer type hints and concise docstrings; use `black`/`ruff` when applicable.
- Notebooks: write formulas in LaTeX within markdown cells.
  - Inline: `$E=mc^2$`
  - Block: `$$\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$$`

## 6. Context Transparency
At the end of each response, always include a section showing which resources were used:

```markdown
---
**Contexto utilizado:**
- **Skills:** [list of skills from .github/skills/ that were referenced]
- **Arquivos:** [list of files that were read or modified]
- **Memória:** [agent memory files from .github/agents/memory/ if consulted]
```

Guidelines:
- Only list skills if explicitly consulted from `.github/skills/`
- List all files read with `read_file` or modified with editing tools
- Include memory files only if actually accessed
- Omit the section entirely for simple conversational responses that don't use external resources
- Keep the format concise and scannable
