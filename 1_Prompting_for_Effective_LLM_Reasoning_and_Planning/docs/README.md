# Module 1: Prompting for Effective LLM Reasoning and Planning

## Documentation Index

This module covers foundational techniques for prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason and plan effectively within agentic workflows. Filenames are zero-padded to ensure correct ordering on GitHub.

### 🐍 Practical Tools & Examples
Supplemental code, snippets and best-practice patterns used across exercises.

- **Code examples:** see the individual guides above (03, 05, 07, 08, 09) for runnable snippets.
- **Validation patterns:** `ast` checks for syntax, `pydantic` for structured output validation, and regex-based parsers for ACT/OBS patterns.
