A simple, effective plan to declutter and organize your workspace within one hour, using only household items, should be straightforward, focused, and sustainable. The goal is to create a clean, functional environment that enhances productivity without overwhelming you or requiring additional purchases. Here's my reasoning for each step before I present the final checklist:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 1: Set a clear intention (5 minutes)**  \n",
       "Begin by clarifying what you want to achieve—whether it’s a tidy desk, more space for essentials, or a more inviting environment. This mental step helps you stay focused and motivated throughout the process.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 2: Clear off your workspace (10 minutes)**  \n",
       "Remove everything from your desk or work surface. This allows you to see the full space and make intentional decisions about what to keep, toss, or relocate. Using a household item like a clean laundry basket or a large cardboard box can serve as a temporary bin for items you’re unsure about.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 3: Sort items into categories (15 minutes)**  \n",
       "Create basic categories such as \"Keep,\" \"Relocate,\" and \"Discard.\" Use piles on the floor or on your cleared desk. For household items, empty containers, or drawers, repurpose existing containers—like a shoebox, a small bowl, or a mug—to hold similar items (pens, paper clips, sticky notes).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 4: Organize and store essentials (20 minutes)**  \n",
       "For the items you’re keeping, find a designated spot. Use existing household containers—like a mug for pens, a small bowl for paper clips, or a drawer organizer (if available)—to group similar items together. If space is tight, consider stacking or repurposing boxes or jars.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 5: Clean and finalize (10 minutes)**  \n",
       "Wipe down your desk and surfaces with a cloth or paper towel (or an old t-shirt). Return your organized items neatly to the desk, arranging them for easy access. Ensure cables are untangled and only essential items are within reach.\n",
